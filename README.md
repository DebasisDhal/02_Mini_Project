2nd project in Spring i hope completed as soon as let's see ok 


FrontDesk Employee Login: The application prompts the employee to log in using their ID and password.
Student Inquiry: After a successful login, the employee can check if a student number exists in the predefined list also can added new students course enrolled or not how much student are available show in a table.
Exit: The employee can exit the program using the menu option.

Overall FrontDesk Employees can login and view her tasks and doing all the tasks for the day those thing base application it is. 

Here i use the Technology are : 

 Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, jQuery, and Thymeleaf, your application can be structured as a web-based application with a backend database and a dynamic frontend. Here's how each technology can fit into the overall architecture:

1. Spring Framework
Purpose: Manages the backend logic, dependency injection, and overall application flow.
Role: The core of your application, managing business logic (e.g., employee login and student inquiries) and integrating with other layers (database, view, etc.).

2. Hibernate
Purpose: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework to map Java objects to database tables.
Role: Used to manage the persistence of Employee and StudentInquiry objects in the MySQL database, allowing you to interact with the database through Java objects.

3. MySQL
Purpose: Relational database management system.
Role: Stores persistent data, such as employee credentials and student information. Hibernate will interact with MySQL to perform CRUD operations.

4. jQuery
Purpose: Simplifies JavaScript code for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.
Role: Enhances the frontend with dynamic features, such as form validations, AJAX-based inquiries, and interactive UI elements.

5. Thymeleaf
Purpose: Server-side Java template engine for rendering dynamic web pages.
Role: Generates the frontend views, integrating with Spring to dynamically render HTML pages. Thymeleaf will handle form submissions for login and inquiries, and display responses.

Application Flow:
Frontend (Thymeleaf + jQuery):

Employees can log in via a form rendered by Thymeleaf.
A student inquiry form allows employees to check student numbers.
jQuery enhances user interactions (e.g., form validation and dynamic content updates).
Backend (Spring + Hibernate):

Spring Controllers: Handle HTTP requests (login, inquiries) and send data to Thymeleaf for rendering.
Service Layer: Contains business logic, such as authenticating employees and processing student inquiries.
Hibernate: Manages the persistence of data in MySQL, converting between Java objects and database records.
Database (MySQL):
Stores employee credentials and student information in structured tables.
Hibernate interacts with MySQL to retrieve or persist data as required.
Example Structure:
Spring Boot Application: Bootstraps the application.
Controller: Handles HTTP requests (e.g., login, inquiry).
Service: Business logic for login and inquiry.
Repository: Hibernate-based data access layer.
MySQL Database: Stores persistent data.
Thymeleaf Views: Generates HTML templates.
jQuery: Enhances frontend interactivity.
This combination provides a full-stack solution for a web-based application with dynamic frontend interactions, robust backend processing, and persistence with Hibernate and MySQL.
